Python challege - PyPoll
Used python to find the total number of votes cast, ist of candidates who received votes, percentage of votes each candidate got, total number of votes each candidate won and the winner of the election.

Written Report:
  There were 14 schools and 39170 students total. The average math score is 78.99 and the average reading score is 81.88 with 74.98% of students passing math, 85.81% passing reading, and 65.17% passing both math and reading. Cabrera High School, Thomas High School, and Griffin High School were amoung the top performers. Rodriguez High, Figueroa High, and Huang were amoung the bottom performing schools. 
  Overall charter schools performed better than ditrict school on math passing rate, reading passing rate and overall passing rate. In both ditrict and charter schools students tended to perform better in math the higher grade they were in school. Seniors tended to perform better then juniors who did better then sophomores, and so on. The same trend was not seen as clearly in the reading scores. The total school budget did not have as much of an affect on the overall passing rate as I expected.
